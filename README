pam_geoip - GeoIP account management module for (Linux-)PAM

pam_geoip.so
============
The PAM module provides the "account" hook only. To use this module, add a
line like 

  account required pam_geoip.so OPTIONS

OPTIONS can be zero or more of
 * system_file=/path/to/geoip.conf 
     Default: /etc/security/geoip.conf
   For the format of this file, see below.

 * geoip_db=/path/to/GeoIPCity.dat 
     Default: /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPCity.dat
   This must be a "GeoIP City Edition" file, see 
      http://www.maxmind.com/app/city
   and / or
      http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
   for more information.
 
 * charset=CHARSET
     Default: UTF-8
   other possible value: iso-8859-1 (case insensitive). Sets the charset of
   the geoip.conf file

The first matching entry in the geoip.conf file wins, i.e. the action given
in this line will be returned to PAM:
 * allow  => PAM_SUCCESS
 * deny   => PAM_PERM_DENIED
 * ignore => PAM_IGNORE

geoip.conf
==========
The configuration file (by default /etc/security/geoip.conf) contains lines
of four items: 
 * domain: user name, group name (prefixed by "@") or "*" for any user/group
 * service: a list of services (or "*") separated by "," (NO spaces allowed)
 * action: "allow", "deny" or "ignore" (see above)
 * location: GeoIP location, separated by ";".  
    This can be:
      - a country code (uppercased two charachers, "*" or "UNKNOWN")
      - a country code like above and "," and a city name (or "*") 
      - a distance from a given point, e.g. "50.0 { 51.513888, 7.465277 }" 

    The location part can use spaces, but note: spaces in city / country
    names must be given as in the DB, i.e. "Mountain View", NOT 
    "Moutain  View" or "MountainView" (w/o the "" of course).

    The distance is measured in kilometers. In the above example we match
    a circle of 100 km diameter around Dortmund, Germany (51° 30′ 50″ north, 
    7° 27′ 50″ east (51.513888888889, 7.465277777777876)). Coordinates west
    and south are given as negative values. Values must be given in decimal.

Example:
#
# /etc/security/geoip.conf - config for pam_geoip.so
#

#<domain>   <service>  <action>  <location>
@wheel      sshd       allow     DE,* ; SE , Nybro; SE, Emmaboda; SE,Växjö
someuser    sshd       allow     50.0 { 51.513888, 7.465277 }; DE,Köln;
otheruser   sshd       allow     SE,Umeå; DK, København
*           *          ignore    UNKNOWN
*           *          deny      *
